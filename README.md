This repository contains the code written for one of the assignments of the course Optimisation as part of the Modelling for Science and Engineering MSc at the Universitat Aut√≤noma de Barcelona (academic year 2023 - 2024). Note that the code in Ex0.c was kindly provided by the professor as a basis to build our own.

The aim of the assignment was to examine different properties of a given graph (in the context of graph theory).

In order to use this programme, it needs to be executed on a .txt file containing a sample graph. The graph's information should be formatted as is exemplified in the file 'SampleGraph.txt', which corresponds to the following diagram:

[comment]: <> (Here goes the diagram of the graph.)

1. Ex1.c : Checking the connectedness of a graph. Given the following definition of connectedness:
An undirected graph is connected when there is a path between each pair of vertices (i.e., there are no inaccessible vertices).
Where a connected component is taken to be the following:
A connected component of an undirected graph is a maximal connected subgraph. Note that each vertex and each edge belongs to a single connected component.
