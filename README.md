This repository contains the code written for one of the assignments of the course Optimisation as part of the Modelling for Science and Engineering MSc at the Universitat Aut√≤noma de Barcelona (academic year 2023 - 2024). Note that the code in Ex0.c was kindly provided by the professor as a basis to build our own. The aim of the assignment was to examine different properties of a given graph (in the context of graph theory).

In order to use this programme, it needs to be executed using a .txt file containing a sample graph as a command-line argument. The graph's information should be formatted as is exemplified in the file 'SampleGraph.txt', which corresponds to the following diagram:\
![Alt text](SampleGraphDiagram.png?raw=true "Sample graph's diagram")\
Note that the first line of the .txt file includes the order of the graph (number of nodes) and the second line includes the number of edges in the graph. From then on, information on the connections between nodes is provided. A limitation of the programmes in this repository is that only one graph can be evaluated at a time and also that the programme can, for now, only take graphs where the number of edges is less than 8 and considers the edges to be undirected.

# Strategy followed
[comment]: <> (BFS implementation explanation)

The code of Ex0.c included most of the information in the main function. Even though this is appropriate for the extension of that part, as I started coding from part 1 on I realized that the code soon started to get very long. In order to increase its readability, I decided to move the part which reads the .txt file into a function before the main part of the program. This way, all the functions could be defined in the preable and then called in the main part of the code, making it easier to read and explain.





# Programs included
## Ex0.c: Basic graph information
Ex0.c checks the information encoded in the .txt file and provides a detailed explanation of the propoerties of the graph, included its node-by-node connections. An output like such is expected if the .txt file is properly formatted:\
```
SampleGraph.txt defines a graph with 4 nodes and 4 edges.

Node 0 has 1 edges:
  0 --> 1
Node 1 has 3 edges:
  1 --> 0
  1 --> 2
  1 --> 3
Node 2 has 2 edges:
  2 --> 1
  2 --> 3
Node 3 has 2 edges:
  3 --> 1
  3 --> 2
```





## Ex1.c: Graph connectedness
Ex1.c : Examines the information of the .txt file and determines whether the graph is connected or not connected. The connectedness of an undirected graph is defined as

[comment]: <> (Here is the definition of connectedness)

An undirected graph is connected when there is a path between each pair of vertices (i.e., there are no inaccessible vertices).
Where a connected component is taken to be the following:
A connected component of an undirected graph is a maximal connected subgraph. Note that each vertex and each edge belongs to a single connected component.

The connectedness of the graph was found using the BFS (breadth-first-search) algorithm.

The output of the program corresponds to 1 if the graph is connected and 0 if it is not connected.
